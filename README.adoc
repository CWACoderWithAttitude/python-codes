Dataclasses are a feature i have to use more often. Since i learn best from writing code i'll write test code how stuff works.
This is provided as devcontainer to be as independant as possible.

Dataclass stuff inspired by https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B9CdKANjnM[Python Dataclasses: Here's 7 Ways It Will Improve Your Code]â€º
